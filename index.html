<h2>Contents</h2>

<p>This project contains data used for testing software developed as part of
the
<a href="https://jddixon.github.io/xlattice">XLattice</a>
project.  Project software has been developed in a number of programming
languages.
To test interoperability it is convenient to have a common set of test
data in a public place: this project.</p>

<p>Derivative data structures to be included are</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://jddixon.github.io/nlhtree_py">NLHTrees</a></li>
<li><a href="https://jddixon.github.io/buildlist">BuildLists</a></li>
<li><a href="https://jddixon.github.io/merkletree">MerkleTrees</a></li>
</ul>

<p>These will shortly be supplemented by</p>

<ul>
<li>SHA test vectors</li>
<li><a href="https://jddixon.github.io/xlattice/chunks.html">Chunks</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Much of this data was derived using variants of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure%20Hash%20Algorithm">Secure Hash Algorithm</a>,
a family of functions each of which can producing a cryptographically secure
number of predetermined length from a document of arbitrary length.
These hash functions are <em>secure</em> in the sense that they are irreversible:
it is for all practical purposes impossible to identify which document a
document corresponds to without doing a systematic serach of the candidates.</p>

<p>In other wrods, an SHA hash is a fixed-length identifier guaranteed to be
unique to a document.  We use three SHA functions: SHA1, which produces
160-bit values; SHA2 (aka sha-256), which produces 256-bit values; and
the 256-bit variant of SHA3.</p>

<h2>Directory Structure</h2>

<p>The key material here is</p>

<ul>
<li>an RSA key used for making digital signatures</li>
<li>a directory tree <code>dataDir</code></li>
<li>and then a number of subdirectories containing data structures derived
from <code>dataDir</code> using project software.</li>
</ul>

<p>The data under <code>binExample.1/</code> is sufficient to verify the correctness of
the BuildList and the 1-to-1 relationship between the files under
<code>binExample.1/datadir/</code> and those under <code>binExample.1/nlhTree/{1,2,3}/uDir/</code></p>

<p>The notation &#39;{1,2,3}&#39; is an abbreviation for &quot;each of the sequence
of values 1, 2, and 3, taken in turn.&quot;</p>

<h3>node</h3>

<p><code>skPriv</code> is the RSA private key used to sign the <code>example.bld</code>
build list.</p>

<h3>dataDir</h3>

<p>As shown in the listing above,
<code>dataDir</code> consists of a
number of data files, at least one of which is empty, and a number of
subdirectories, at least one of which is empty.  Where files are populated,
the file consists of a random number of random bytes.</p>

<p>The information under <code>dataDir/</code> is a small directory tree.
The <code>data*</code> are data files containing quasi-random data.  Both the
file length and the contents are random.  <code>data12</code> is an empty file.
Subdirectory <code>subDir2</code> is an empty subdirectory.</p>

<h3>sha subdirectories</h3>

<p>The information in these subdirectories is derived from that under
<strong>dataDir</strong> using one of the three Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) types
supported, SHA1, SHA2, and SHA3, where <code>SHA2</code> means SHA256
and <code>SHA3</code> means SHA3-256, the 256-bit version of <strong>Keccak</strong>.</p>

<h4>example.nlh</h4>

<p>This is the serialization of the NLHTree describing the data files
under <code>dataDir</code>.</p>

<h4>example.bld and buildlist.hex</h4>

<p><code>example.bld</code> is a BuildList for <code>dataDir</code>.  The BuildList contains
the public part of the RSA key used to sign the list, its title,
and a UTC timestamp, the time at which the list was signed.  The
body of the list is an indented list of the files under <code>dataDir/</code>,
with a line for each file, each line containing the SHA content
hash of the document and its title.  The BuildList ends with a
digital signature over the earlier part of the document.  In this
example, the RSA private key used in signing the document in
contained in <code>node/skPriv</code>.</p>

<p><code>buildlist.hex</code> is the BuildList hash, a 40-character hexadecimal
value unique to the BuildList.</p>

<h4>example.merkle and merkle.hex</h4>

<p>The MerkleTree is another data structure useful for describing
directory structures.  <code>example.merkle</code> is the serialization of
the MerkleTree for <code>dataDir/</code>.  <code>merkle.hex</code> is the single value
specifying the whole tree in hexadecimal form.</p>

<h4>DIR_FLAT, DIR16x16, DIR256x256</h4>

<p>These are three different ways of organizing content-keyed directories.</p>

<p>In the first, <code>DIR_FLAG</code>, all files are collected in one directory.
This is suitable for small collections of data.</p>

<p>In the second, <code>DIR16x16</code>, there are 16 subdirectories <code>0/</code> through `f/&#39;
and below each of these 16 further subdirectories, each named with a
hexadecimal digit.  This gives us a total of 256 subdirectories, each
of which contains data files whose content keys begin with the
corresponding two hex digits.</p>

<p>Under each of the three structural headings there is a content keyed
data store, <code>uDir</code>.  Each of the nine different versions of <code>uDir</code>
contains the same files as <code>dataDir</code> named by the corresponding
content key.</p>

<h2>Project Status</h2>

<p>A skeletal repository as yet containing no test data.  It is organized as
a Python project to ease project management.</p>
